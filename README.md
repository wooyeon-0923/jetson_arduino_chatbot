# **Jetson Nano Air Quality Monitoring and AI Chatbot**

## üí° **Project Overview**

This project focuses on leveraging **Jetson Nano** and various sensors to develop an **Air Quality Monitoring System** aimed at optimizing learning environments. By monitoring air pollutants such as fine dust (PM10) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the system provides real-time data and actionable recommendations via an interactive AI-powered chatbot.

The project integrates **Gradio UI**, **OpenAI GPT-4**, and **environmental sensors** to create a comprehensive solution for indoor air quality (IAQ) management, helping users make informed decisions about ventilation and air purifier usage.

---

## üìö **Background and Motivation**

Air quality significantly impacts human health and productivity, particularly in learning environments. According to the **School Health Act**, maintaining specific standards for indoor air quality is crucial to optimizing cognitive performance.  
This project aims to measure, analyze, and improve indoor air quality by:
1. Deploying state-of-the-art sensors for real-time data collection.
2. Comparing measured values against external benchmarks using the **Korean Meteorological Administration (KMA) PM10 API**.
3. Providing insights and recommendations through a **user-friendly chatbot** interface.

---

## üéØ **Key Features**

1. **Real-Time Data Monitoring**  
   - Utilize sensors such as **Grove Dust Sensor** and **CM1106 CO2 Sensor** to track fine dust and CO2 concentrations in ¬µg/m¬≥ and ppm, respectively.

2. **Comparative Analysis with External Data**  
   - Fetch PM10 data via the **KMA API** and compare it with real-time sensor data to enhance accuracy and reliability.

3. **Interactive AI Chatbot**  
   - Built using **Gradio UI** and **OpenAI GPT-4**, the chatbot allows users to query air quality status and receive actionable advice.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**  
   - Predict future air quality trends and provide proactive recommendations.

5. **Customizable Notifications**  
   - Alert users when air quality exceeds predefined thresholds, prompting corrective actions like opening windows or using an air purifier.
